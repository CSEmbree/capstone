Possible Good Features Extractable from Audio

Energy 
- Compute energy as root mean square of an audio Frame.

EnvelopeShapeStatistics 
- Centroid, spread, skewness and kurtosis of each frameâ€™s amplitude envelope. For more details about moments, see Shape Statistics.

Loudness 
- The loudness coefficients are the energy in each Bark band, normalized by the overall sum.

MFCC 
- Compute the Mel-frequencies cepstrum coefficients.

PerceptualSharpness 
- Compute the sharpness of Loudness coefficients, according to [GP2004].

PerceptualSpread 
- Compute the spread of Loudness coefficients, according to [GP2004].

SpectralFlatness (per band?) 
- Compute global spectral flatness using the ratio between geometric and arithmetic mean.

SpectralShapeStatistics 
- Compute shape statistics of MagnitudeSpectrum, (see [GR2004]). Shape Statistics are centroid, spread, skewness and kurtosis.
