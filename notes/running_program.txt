Run program with format:

         ./mr <# of runs> <# of duration per recording in seconds>



NOTES:
Duration of 0 seconds means it will record infinitly
	 ./mr 0 5 
//Record infinitly in 5 second chunks 



EXAMPLES:
BASIC - make one recording of length 2 seconds
         ./mr

NORAML - make 5 recordings each of length 6 seconds
         ./mr 5 6

INFINITE - make infinite recordings each of length 4 seconds
	 ./mr 0 4
